The <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Advisory_Board">OSM Advisory Board</a> can help direct your question -- contact them at advisoryboard(at)osmfoundation.org

The <a href="https://wordpress.com/post/osmwelcomemat.wordpress.com/3">OSM Working Groups</a> may cover your question if itâ€™s about a specific topic such as licensing or press inquiries.

If you want to talk with the community in a specific region, please consult the <a href="wiki.openstreetmap.org">OSM Wiki</a>.
