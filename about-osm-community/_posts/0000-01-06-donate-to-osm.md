title: How can we give money to OpenStreetMap?
---

There are three ways to financially support the project:
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Corporate membership</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Donations</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Local Chapters</span></li>
</ul>

A great way to support OpenStreetMap financially is by becoming a <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Membership#Corporate_Members">Corporate Member</a> of the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Corporate membership tiers start at €500 for the Supporter level and go up to €20,000 or more annually for the Platinum level. Each tier comes with a number of additional benefits. Corporate members of Silver and higher levels have a seat on the OSMF Advisory Board.

<a href="https://donate.openstreetmap.org">Donations</a> of any amount are also more than welcome. OpenStreetMap is a registered non-profit in the United Kingdom.

If you are interested in becoming a Corporate Member or learning more about donating, please get in touch with the OSM Foundation Board of Directors at <a href="mailto:board@osmfoundation.org">board@osmfoundation.org</a>

If an OSM Local Chapter exists in your jurisdiction, you may also want to consider donating to them directly. Donations to Local Chapters benefit their work supporting the OpenStreetMap project and community at the local level. Donations to Local Chapters may be tax-exempt, depending on local tax law. For details, inquire with the Local Chapter directly. You can find them at the OSM Wiki, <a href="wiki.openstreetmap.org">wiki.openstreetmap.org</a>
