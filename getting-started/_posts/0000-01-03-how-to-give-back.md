title: How can we give back?
---

## Why should an organization contribute data to OpenStreetMap?

* Adding data to OSM is quicker and easier than building your own system: you benefit from updates to the software, the ecosystem and collaborative maintenance of the data
* Allows an organisation to focus on its core data, rather than also maintaining geospatial data
* Shared platform to contribute and collaborate with others
* Broader social good of contributing to a global map, OSM as a public good

## Why other ways can we contribute?

* Becoming a member or supporter helps contribute to sustainability of the project (reference other organisations that are doing that)
* Contributing imagery or other data such as GPS traces can help improve the map for all and provide a means for the community to use that information to collect new data
* Thereâ€™s also a range of supporting open source infrastructure which would benefit from contribution and support from wider community
* There is also a need for advocacy about OpenStreetMap, training, community engagement and more. You can contribute to OpenStreetMap without actually editing the map
