title: How can I research with OSM?
---

Research is a welcome part of the OSM community. From Kathmandu to Berlin, there is a rich history of research about OSM -- the community, the project, and the data. Before starting out, we encourage you to get in touch with the local OSM community and review the background on OSM research. Of course, you can find details on Google Scholar, but here are <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Research">some examples</a> to help you get started.

There is also an email list for research, <a href="mailto:research-announce@lists.openstreetmap.org">research-announce@lists.openstreetmap.org</a>, and a number of wOSM Wiki pages that relate to research:

<h2>Could OSM provide a letter of support for our research project?</h2>
As OSM is a distributed, global community with diverse expertise, OSM does not provide an exclusive letter of support for any given topic. We encourage researchers to connect with their local OSM community and/or chapter. The benefit of researchers working within the community is that they can seek guidance and context about the work which will add value to the end product. 

For these reasons, the OSMF Board does not formally give letters of support for research. We do, however, recommend that you contact previous researchers to build on their work. During your research journey, we do encourage you to connect with the community, join the events and share your research. Many researchers have presented at the various State of the Map events around the world. Their perspectives are very welcome and contribute to the corpus of OSM knowledge. 

Weâ€™ve also prepared <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Researcher_Information">guidance</a> for research citations and so on.
