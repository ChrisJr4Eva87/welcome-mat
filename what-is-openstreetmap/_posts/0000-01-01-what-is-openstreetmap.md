title: What is OpenStreetMap?
---

OpenStreetMap is a free, editable map of the whole world made by people like you. It was started in 2004 in the UK, out of frustration with the lack of availability of good map data that was free to use.

The map is created and maintained by nearly 5 million registered users and more than 1 million map contributors in every country in the world, using free tools and software.

OpenStreetMap includes data about roads, trails, buildings, shops, points of interest, railways, transit, land use and natural features, and much more.

The project has a very lean governance structure run entirely by volunteers (link to ‘what organizations make up OSM’). Financial support comes from the OpenStreetMap Foundation  members, including corporate members, as well as donations.
