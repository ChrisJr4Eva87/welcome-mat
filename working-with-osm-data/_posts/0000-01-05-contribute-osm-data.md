title: Organized Editing in OpenStreetMap
---

There are some guidelines and best practices for organized editing of OpenStreetMap, which are based on experiences from several companies and organizations. The goal is to standardize around a set of practices that encourage involvement in OpenStreetMap, contribute high quality mapping data, provide transparency around practices and provide support for and cooperation with local and global OSM communities. Â 

## What is Organized Editing?

* An institution directs editing activities in OpenStreetMap for which the mappers have some form of direct benefit.
  * That benefit could include remuneration, fulfilling an academic or course obligation, or some other tangible exchange.
* Situations like mapping parties, mapathons or workshops typically would not qualify if individuals are engaging with a group in order to only gain experience, volunteer, contribute, and learn.

## Best Practices For Organized Editing
### Declare affiliations

Be visible as a group and as individuals -- say who you are. This helps the community understand who is participating and why.

* Have a visible presence in the OSM community, such as a GitHub page
* List the OSM accounts associated with a team
* Declare organizational affiliations in mapper profile pages
* Designate a public lead or leads

### Communicate and be contactable

* Messages and comments should get prompt responses
* Designated leads should be reachable and responsive
* Publish relevant details on mapping projects and invite input
* Proactively reach out and develop relationships with local communities where you plan to work
* Share accomplishments and results periodically with the OSM community
* Established organized editing teams should help onboard new organized editing teams and share best practices with them

### Quality Control

* For group editing, have integrated quality assurance processes that reflect the types of quality control you would expect for your organization
* Implement and share quality assurance tools and processes
